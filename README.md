# .desktop
My .desktop files



This contribution makes it easy for me to set the desktop icons on a fresh install. To be self-contained, each desktop entry is accompanied by an icon -- the logo of the application. All the entries were tried on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Gnome 3 desktop environment. Note that you may need to change the path to the executable or to the icon, depending on where they are on your system. To find where a specific program is installed, use `which your_program` or `whereis your_program`.
